public class Assignment3 {
	
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with
						 the public interest.
						 
						 2.01. Provide service in their areas of competence, being honest and forthright about any limitations of their experience
						 	   and education.
							
						 EX: A university level software engineer was employed to develop a code impacting his city at a large company.
							 He agreed to write the code without help despite being immediately aware that his skill level was not near competent 
							 enough to complete the task at hand. This type of practice violates the above principle. 
							
3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

			 3.02. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project on which they work or propose.

			 EX: A software engineer working on a customized streaming service for individuals proposes to the app developer that she can finish
				 the code in under three months. She promises this to the developer so that he will hire her over the software engineers competitors;
				 however, she knows it will be impossible to complete the project in that little time. This type of practice violates the above 
				 principle. 
				
4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

			  4.04. Not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double billing, or other improper financial practices.
			
			  EX: A software engineer is working for an apartment complex writing code for rent payments. He sets it up so that every month when 
				  the residents go to pay rent electronically, there is a convenience fee of $2 which is then rerouted inconspicuously to his own 
				  bank account. This type of practice violates the above principle. 

5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software 
				development and maintenance.
				
				5.06. Attract potential software engineers only by full and accurate description of the conditions of employment.
				
				EX: A software engineering manager is working to hire a recent university graduate that she thinks will be a great addition to
					her team. In order to appeal to the recent graduate, she promises a 35 hour work week with all meetings ending by 12PM on 
					on Fridays, and assures him there will never be any working weekends. Nevertheless, two months after starting, the university 
					graduate finds himself working nearly 50 hours on weekdays and even needing to frequently come in on Saturdays. This type of 
					practice violates the above principle.
					
6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

				6.08. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors in software and associated documents on which they work.
				
				EX: A software engineer has been working on a code for awhile for a client. When the meeting comes to have a test run and do some 
					prototyping, several different errors in the code arise. The main software engineer deflects responsibility for the mistakes 
					and claims his colleagues failed to be specific in communicating the needs of the client when in reality, he had been cognicent
					of the errors but had not made an attempt to fix them. This type of practice violates the above principle.
